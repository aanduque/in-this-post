When we write our long posts in our blogs it is a best practice to separate the different topics and subtopics by using heading elements (h1, h2, h3 and so on).<br/><br/>Why not expand this common practice to provide your readers with an easy way to navigate between topics in the post and give them a real sense of what you are talking about by the topics headlines?<br/><br/><strong>With jQuery In This Post</strong> you can do just that, add a awesome navigational bar that show your readers where they are in your post and what is coming next. It also supports <strong>comments block</strong>, so they can comment to your post as soon as they finish to read it!<br/><br/>Don't get what we are talking about?
